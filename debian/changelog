ros-hydro-robot-localization (1.2.1-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * Fixed issue with out-of-order measurements and pose resets
  * Nodes now assume ENU standard for yaw data
  * Removed gps_common dependency
  * Adding option to navsat_transform_node that enables the use of the heading from the odometry message instead of an IMU.
  * Changed frame_id used in setPoseCallback to be the world_frame
  * Optimized Eigen arithmetic for signficiant performance boost
  * Code refactoring and reorganization
  * Removed roll and pitch from navsat_transform calculations
  * Fixed transform for IMU data to better support mounting IMUs in non-standard orientations
  * Added feature to navsat_transform_node whereby filtered odometry data can be coverted back into navsat data
  * Added a parameter to allow future dating the world_frame->base_link_frame transform.
  * Removed deprecated differential setting handler
  * Added relative mode
  * Updated and improved tests
  * Fixing source frame_id in pose data handling
  * Added initial covariance parameter
  * Fixed bug in covariance copyinh
  * Added parameters for topic queue sizes
  * Improved motion model's handling of angular velocities when robot has non-zero roll and pitch
  * Changed the way differential measurements are handled
  * Added diagnostics
