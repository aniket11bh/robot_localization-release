ros-indigo-robot-localization (2.2.2-1saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Updating trig functions to use sincos for efficiency
  * Updating licensing information and adding Eigen MPL-only flag
  * Added state to imu frame transformation
  * Using state orientation if imu orientation is missing
  * Manually adding second spin for odometry and IMU data that is passed to message filters
  * Reducing delay between measurement reception and filter output
  * Zero altitute in intital transform too, when zero altitude param is set
  * Fixing regression with conversion back to GPS coordinates
  * Switched cropping of orientation data in inovationSubset with mahalanobis check to prevent excluding measurements with orientations bigger/smaller than Â± PI
  * Fix Jacobian for EKF.
  * Removing warning about orientation variables when only their velocities are measured
  * Checking for -1 in IMU covariances and ignoring relevant message data
  * roslint and catkin_lint applied
  * Adding base_link to datum specification, and fixing bug with order of measurement handling when a datum is specified. Also added check to make sure IMU data is transformable before using it.
